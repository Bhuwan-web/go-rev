# Go Weekend Warriors 🚀

A casual revision repo for brushing up on Go concepts during free time (mostly weekends, when the coffee hits just right ☕).

## What's This About? 🤔

This is my personal playground for revisiting Go fundamentals and trying out new concepts. Think of it as a digital notebook where I dump code snippets, experiment with features, and occasionally remember why I love this language.

## Learning Approach 📚

- **Weekend Learning**: Because weekdays are for production bugs, weekends are for learning bugs 🐛
- **Concept Revision**: Going back to basics, one `func main()` at a time
- **Go by Example**: Following the excellent [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) tutorials
- **Hands-on Practice**: Less theory, more "let's see what happens when I run this"

## What You'll Find Here 🔍

- Basic Go syntax and concepts
- Channel experiments (because concurrency is fun until it's not)
- Generic implementations (Go 1.18+ features)
- Random code snippets that seemed like a good idea at the time
- Comments that future me will hopefully understand

## Resources 📖

- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - The gold standard for learning Go
- [The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/doc/) - Official docs
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) - Interactive learning

## Running the Code 🏃‍♂️

```bash
go run main.go
```

That's it. Go keeps things simple, and so do we.

## Contributing 🤝

This is a personal learning repo, but if you spot something wildly incorrect or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue. Just remember: this code is for learning, not for production (please don't use this in production 😅).
